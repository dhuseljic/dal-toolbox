# Ablation Study for weight decay

In this ablation, we want to investigate the influence of weight decay for SNGP and different sample sizes.

Questions we want to look at:
- Does weight decay have an influence on the performance and uncertianty modeling?
- Is a higher value for weight decay better when working with few samples?
